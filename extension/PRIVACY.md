# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2025

## Introduction

3things is a Chrome extension designed to help users focus on what matters most by limiting their daily to-do list to three essential tasks. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Data Collection

### What Data We Collect
3things does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit personal data to external servers.

### Chrome Sync Storage
All data is stored using Chrome's Sync Storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`):
- **Task data**: Your daily tasks and completion status
- **Historical data**: Past tasks (stored indefinitely)
- **Settings**: Any user preferences

**Cross-Device Synchronization:**
Your data is automatically synchronized across all your Chrome devices where you're signed in with the same Google account. This includes:
- Desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Chromebooks
- Mobile devices (Android, iOS)

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- Data is encrypted by Chrome during transmission
- Data is stored in your personal Google account storage
- We (the developers) cannot access your data
- Data is never shared with third parties

## Analytics

### Anonymous Usage Statistics
To improve the extension, we collect **anonymous** usage statistics using Cloudflare Web Analytics:

**What we track:**
- Daily active users
- Extension installations and updates
- Core feature usage (tasks added, completed, deleted)
- Feature interactions (history views, downloads)

**Privacy guarantees for analytics:**
- ✅ **No personal data**: No names, emails, or identifiers
- ✅ **No cookies**: No tracking cookies or local storage for profiling
- ✅ **Anonymous IDs**: Uses random UUID that stays local to your device
- ✅ **GDPR compliant**: Privacy-first analytics that respects user privacy
- ✅ **No cross-site tracking**: Analytics only track this extension
- ✅ **Opt-out available**: You can disable analytics by uninstalling the extension

**How analytics work:**
- Uses Cloudflare's privacy-first Web Analytics service
- Events are sent via virtual pageviews using browser History API
- Only aggregates and anonymous data are collected
- No individual user behavior can be traced back to a person
- Data is used solely for improving user experience and fixing bugs

## Data Usage

### How We Use Your Data
Your data is used exclusively for:
- Displaying your daily tasks
